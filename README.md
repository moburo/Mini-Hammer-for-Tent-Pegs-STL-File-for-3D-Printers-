# Peg Hammer for 3D Printer STL Data
A peg hammer for tents.  I made it myself in search of a light and small hammer.
A printer that can model up to 200 * 200 mm in length and width can output at 90%.
I think that it is more durable to fill the inside as it is, but it will be heavier by that amount and filament will be used.
